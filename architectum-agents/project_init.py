### Phase Progress
- [ ] **1. Ideation** - project_brief.md
- [ ] **2. Requirements** - prd.md  
- [ ] **3. Architecture** - architecture.md
- [ ] **4. Frontend Architecture** - frontend-architecture.md (if applicable)
- [ ] **5. Epic Breakdown** - epic-*.md files
- [ ] **6. Story Preparation** - story-*.md files
- [ ] **7. Doc Sharding** - supporting_documents/*
- [ ] **8. Ready for Dev** - all artifacts complete

**Current Epic:** None  
**Current Story:** None

### Notes
*Project notes and key decisions will be tracked here*

## Core Documents
- [Project Brief](core_documents/project_brief.md) - Initial project definition
- [Product Requirements](core_documents/prd.md) - Detailed requirements and epics
- [Architecture](core_documents/architecture.md) - Technical architecture and design
- [Frontend Architecture](core_documents/frontend-architecture.md) - Frontend-specific architecture (if applicable)

## Epics & Stories
{Epic directories will be created during planning phase}

## Supporting Documents
{Detailed documentation will be generated during sharding phase}

## Catalogs
- [Project Catalog](catalogs/project_catalog.yaml) - File and component inventory
- [Feature Catalog](catalogs/feature_catalog.yaml) - Feature-to-code mapping
- [Test Catalog](catalogs/test_catalog.yaml) - Test code mapping
