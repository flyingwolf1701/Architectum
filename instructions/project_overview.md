# Architectum Project Overview
status: in progress

## Vision

Architectum is an AI-first code comprehension system that leverages Language Server Protocol (LSP) to analyze codebases and transform them into structured XML blueprints. By extracting the architectural essence of code files without implementation details, Architectum enables more effective collaboration between developers and AI assistants.

The project addresses the fundamental challenge of providing AI with the right level of contextual understanding of a codebaseâ€”detailed enough for meaningful assistance but abstracted enough to fit within token limitations and avoid overwhelming the AI with irrelevant implementation details. By using LSP's accurate parsing combined with configurable XML representations, Architectum creates code maps that dramatically improve AI's ability to reason about complex software systems.

## Core Concepts

- **LSP-Powered Analysis**: Leverage Language Server Protocol as the engine for accurate code structure extraction
- **Framework-Aware Extraction**: Special handling for framework-specific patterns in React, Vue, and other frameworks
- **File-Based XML Representation**: Transform extracted information into structured XML optimized for AI comprehension
- **Language-Neutral Architecture**: Unified representation across multiple programming languages and frameworks
- **Multi-Level Indexing**: Configurable hierarchical views from system-wide summaries to detailed component specifications

## Applications

### AI Assistance Enhancement

- Provide AI with focused structural context without implementation details
- Enable precise contextual understanding for code generation
- Support planning and architectural discussions
- Optimize token usage in AI context windows (5-10x more architectural context in the same token budget)

### Developer Tools

- Visualize system architecture and dependencies
- Document code structure automatically

### Technical Documentation

- Generate structural documentation from code
- Support technical decision making
