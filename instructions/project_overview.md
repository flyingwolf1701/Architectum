Qapla' Fitness helps users build consistent, sustainable fitness habits through adaptive movement flows, breath-led intent, and a gamified reward system. Designed to minimize friction and maximize presence, the app rewards users for simply starting and guides them through bodyweight or machine-based workouts that scale with skill and confidence.

The MVP is delivered as a web app with a future roadmap toward Android phone and watch integration. Initial focus is on Calisthenics and Gym Machines. Future expansions include additional workout types, recovery tools, and new progression formats.

## **Workout Philosophy**

* **Starting is the win**: Users earn high-value points for simply beginning their session.
* **Progress through adaptability**: Movements scale up/down within a session; regressions are embraced, not punished.
* **Structure with freedom**: Users can change movement order, modify difficulty, or reattempt.
* **Whole-body design**: Every session incorporates core, fascia work, and at least two additional movement groups.
* **Low friction, high reward**: Clean UI, minimal input required, and clear progress tracking.

## **Key Features**

### ‚úÖ **Gamified Point System**

* +500 pts: Starting the workout
* +100 pts: Each warm-up or movement group started
* +1 pt per rep or second of active work
* Bonus points for higher-level completions
* *Points are only visible on phone (not watch)*

### ‚úÖ **Progressive Movement Engine**

* Default movement target: 50 reps (or time-based equivalent)
* Adaptive block design:

  * Start with warm-up of 10 at **Level N-2 and 10 at Level N-1**

    * if N-2 or N-1 are less then one then it is level 1
  * Continue with as many reps as possible at **Level N**
  * If not enough to hit the target, regress via **Decrease Row** through lower levels
  * Hitting the full target (any mix of levels) = **Victory**
  * Completing Level N's full segment (without decrease) unlocks **Level N+1** for future sessions
* Controls: **‚¨Ü Up**, **‚¨á Down**, **‚úÖ Done** to end block

### ‚úÖ **Machine-Based Adaptation**

* Each level corresponds to a weight range
* UI matches the calisthenics flow: up/down to adjust load, done to complete
* Reps are still tracked to contribute toward the target goal
