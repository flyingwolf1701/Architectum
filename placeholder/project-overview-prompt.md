- Who is it for?
- What makes it unique or valuable?
- How does it fit into the broader technical ecosystem?

### Core Concepts
List 4-6 foundational ideas or principles that define the project:
- **[Concept Name]**: Brief explanation (1-2 sentences)
- Prioritize clarity over comprehensiveness

### System Pillars
For each major component or subsystem:

#### 1. [Pillar Name]
- Key responsibilities and features
- Technologies or approaches used

- ‚è≥ Planned features

Include timeline estimates where appropriate but focus on logical progression rather than specific dates.

### Technical Stack
List and briefly justify major technologies:

#### Current
- Language choices and rationale
- Frameworks and libraries
- Data storage and processing
- Infrastructure and deployment

#### Planned Extensions
- Technologies being considered
- Migration plans
- Experimental approaches

### Engineering Principles
List 5-7 guiding principles that inform technical decisions:
- Focus on principles specific to this project
- Explain how each principle shapes the architecture or implementation

### Status
A concise statement of the current project status, major milestones achieved, and next immediate steps.

## Style Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language avoiding unnecessary jargon
- Balance technical depth with accessibility
- Use bullet points and lists for scannability
