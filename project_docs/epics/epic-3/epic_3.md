# Epic 3: Blueprint Generation System

> This document is a granulated shard from the main "Architectum Product Requirements Document" focusing on "Epic 3: Blueprint Generation System".

## Epic Goal
Create the blueprint generation capabilities that transform core representations into AI-optimized and human-readable outputs.

## User Stories

### Story 3.1: Path-Based Blueprint Generation
**As a user, I want to generate Path-Based Blueprints so that I can analyze directory structures with configurable depth.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Path-based blueprint command accepts directory path and depth parameters
- Depth 0 includes all subdirectories recursively
- Depth 1 includes only immediate subdirectory contents
- Blueprint output includes file relationships within the specified scope
- Generated blueprint is optimized for AI token efficiency
- Human-readable format option is available
- Command provides clear feedback on scope and file counts

### Story 3.2: Method-Based Blueprint Generation
**As a user, I want to generate Method-Based Blueprints so that I can focus on specific functions or classes.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Method-based blueprint command accepts function/class identifiers
- Blueprint includes the target method/class and all its dependencies
- Caller relationships are included to show usage context
- Related types and interfaces are automatically included
- Blueprint scope can be limited to prevent excessive expansion
- Output format is suitable for detailed code analysis
- Multiple methods/classes can be included in a single blueprint

### Story 3.3: YAML-Based Blueprint Definitions
**As a user, I want YAML-based blueprint definitions so that I can declaratively specify complex blueprint requirements.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- YAML schema is defined for blueprint specifications
- Component selection supports files, functions, classes, and features
- Feature tagging allows logical grouping of related components
- Include/exclude patterns provide fine-grained control
- YAML files can be version-controlled and shared
- Validation ensures YAML definitions are syntactically correct
- Error messages clearly indicate YAML syntax or semantic issues

### Story 3.4: Multiple Output Formats
**As a system, I want multiple output formats so that blueprints can serve both AI consumption and human visualization needs.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- JSON format provides structured data for programmatic use
- XML format is optimized for AI model consumption (if token-efficient)
- Markdown format offers human-readable documentation
- DOT format enables graph visualization tools
- Format selection is available via command-line parameter
- All formats contain equivalent information with appropriate structure
- Performance impact of format generation is minimal

### Story 3.5: Persistent Feature Blueprints
**As a user, I want persistent Feature Blueprints so that important code documentation can be saved and versioned.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Feature blueprints can be saved with descriptive names
- Saved blueprints can be regenerated with updated code
- Blueprint metadata includes creation date and scope information
- Blueprints can be organized into collections or categories
- Export/import functionality allows sharing between projects
- Saved blueprints integrate with version control systems
- Command can list all saved blueprints with summary information

## Dependencies
- Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (must be completed)
- Epic 2: Language Parsing & Relationship Extraction (must be completed)
- System Map and JSON Mirrors must be populated with data
- CLI framework must support command extensions

## Success Criteria
- All blueprint types can be generated successfully
- YAML-based definitions provide flexible blueprint specification
- Output formats serve their intended audiences effectively
- Token efficiency targets are met for AI-optimized formats
- Blueprint generation completes within 30 seconds for typical projects
- Persistent storage enables blueprint reuse and sharing
- All blueprint generation components have â‰¥80% test coverage
