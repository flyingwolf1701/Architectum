# Epic 5: Proof-of-Concept Visualizer

> This document is a granulated shard from the main "Architectum Product Requirements Document" focusing on "Epic 5: Proof-of-Concept Visualizer".

## Epic Goal
Deliver a basic but functional visualization capability that demonstrates the power of relationship-based code representation.

## User Stories

### Story 5.1: Web-Based Graph Renderer
**As a user, I want a web-based graph renderer so that I can visualize code relationships in my browser.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Web interface renders System Map data as an interactive graph
- Nodes represent different code elements (files, functions, classes)
- Edges represent relationships between code elements
- Graph layout is automatically optimized for readability
- Basic styling differentiates node and edge types
- Browser compatibility includes modern browsers
- Web server can be started via CLI command

### Story 5.2: Interactive Navigation
**As a user, I want interactive navigation so that I can explore relationships by clicking through the graph.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clicking nodes reveals detailed information about code elements
- Double-clicking nodes expands to show related elements
- Edge traversal follows relationship paths
- Zoom and pan functionality allows graph exploration
- Node selection highlights related connections
- Breadcrumb navigation shows exploration history
- Context menus provide additional actions

### Story 5.3: Filtering Controls
**As a user, I want filtering controls so that I can focus on specific aspects of my codebase.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Filter by node type (files, functions, classes, etc.)
- Filter by relationship type (calls, imports, inherits, etc.)
- Filter by file path patterns or regular expressions
- Filter by feature tags when available
- Multiple filters can be combined
- Filter state is preserved during navigation
- Reset functionality clears all filters

### Story 5.4: Export Capabilities
**As a user, I want export capabilities so that I can share visualizations with my team.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Export current graph view as PNG or SVG image
- Export filtered data as JSON for external analysis
- Export graph structure in DOT format for other visualization tools
- Share functionality generates shareable URLs for specific views
- Export includes current filter and navigation state
- Batch export processes multiple views automatically
- Export quality is suitable for presentations and documentation

## Dependencies
- Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (must be completed)
- Epic 2: Language Parsing & Relationship Extraction (must be completed)
- Epic 3: Blueprint Generation System (must be completed)
- Epic 4: Caching & Performance Optimization (recommended)
- Populated System Map with relationship data
- Blueprint generation functionality

## Success Criteria
- Web-based visualizer demonstrates relationship navigation effectively
- Interactive features provide intuitive exploration experience
- Filtering capabilities allow focused analysis of large codebases
- Export functionality enables sharing and documentation
- Performance remains responsive with graphs of 1000+ nodes
- User interface is intuitive for developers unfamiliar with the tool
- All visualization components have â‰¥80% test coverage
