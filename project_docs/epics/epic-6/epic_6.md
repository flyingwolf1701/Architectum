- **Epic 2**: Language Parsing & Relationship Extraction (complete)
- **Epic 3**: Blueprint Generation System (complete)
- **Epic 4**: Caching & Performance Optimization (complete)
- **Epic 5**: Proof-of-Concept Visualizer (complete)

### Technical Dependencies
- **Stable Core Feature Set**: All core functionality must be feature-complete
- **API Stability**: CLI interface and configuration formats must be stable
- **Performance Baselines**: Established performance benchmarks for regression testing
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite for distribution validation

## Success Criteria

### User Adoption Metrics
- **Installation Success Rate**: >95% successful installations across platforms
- **Documentation Completeness**: All core features documented with examples
- **User Onboarding Time**: New users productive within 30 minutes
- **Community Engagement**: Active usage and community contributions

### Technical Quality Metrics
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: 100% compatibility across supported platforms
- **Performance Consistency**: <5% performance variance across versions
- **Security Compliance**: Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- **Upgrade Success Rate**: >98% successful upgrades between versions

### Distribution Effectiveness

- **Installation Speed**: <2 minutes for complete installation
- **Dependency Conflicts**: <1% installation failures due to dependency issues
- **Release Cadence**: Predictable and documented release schedule

## Epic Boundaries

### In Scope
- Production-ready packaging and distribution
- Comprehensive end-user and developer documentation
- Automated testing and deployment infrastructure
- Migration and upgrade tooling
- Production configuration and monitoring

### Out of Scope
- Advanced enterprise features beyond MVP
- Custom integrations for specific platforms
- Premium support or consulting services
- Advanced analytics or usage tracking
- Plugin marketplace or ecosystem management

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Distribution Complexity**: Mitigate with automated testing across multiple environments
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Establish automated documentation generation where possible
- **Version Compatibility**: Implement comprehensive migration testing and rollback procedures

### Adoption Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Mitigate with progressive tutorials and interactive examples
- **Installation Friction**: Provide multiple installation methods and clear troubleshooting
- **Integration Challenges**: Develop comprehensive integration guides and examples

## Implementation Notes

### Sequencing with Other Epics
- **Parallel Development**: Documentation can begin during Epic 1-4 development
- **Feature Documentation**: Document features as they're completed in previous epics
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive testing only possible after Epic 1-5 completion

### Quality Gates
- **Documentation Review**: All documentation must be reviewed by both technical and non-technical users
