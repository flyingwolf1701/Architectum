# Epic 4: Caching & Performance Optimization

> This document is a granulated shard from the main "Architectum Product Requirements Document" focusing on "Epic 4: Caching & Performance Optimization".

## Epic Goal
Implement intelligent caching, database storage, and incremental update mechanisms to ensure system performance scales with codebase size.

## User Stories

### Story 4.1: SQLite Database Storage
**As a system, I want SQLite database storage so that System Map and JSON Mirror data can be efficiently persisted and queried.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- SQLite database schema supports System Map node and relationship storage
- JSON Mirror content is stored with efficient retrieval mechanisms
- Database indexes optimize common query patterns
- Database file location is configurable
- Migration system handles schema updates
- Database integrity checks prevent corruption
- Backup and restore functionality is available

### Story 4.2: File-Based Change Detection
**As a system, I want file-based change detection so that only modified code is reprocessed during updates.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- File hash tracking identifies changed files since last sync
- Timestamp comparison provides fast change detection
- Change detection respects .gitignore rules and configuration
- Modified files trigger reprocessing of dependent relationships
- Deleted files are removed from System Map and JSON Mirrors
- New files are automatically detected and processed
- Change summary reports what was updated

### Story 4.3: Blueprint Caching
**As a system, I want blueprint caching so that frequently accessed views load instantly.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Generated blueprints are cached with content hashes
- Cache invalidation occurs when underlying code changes
- Cache storage location is configurable
- Cache size limits prevent excessive disk usage
- Cache hit ratio is monitored and reported
- Manual cache clearing is available via CLI command
- Cache efficiency metrics are tracked

### Story 4.4: Incremental System Map Updates
**As a system, I want incremental System Map updates so that large codebases remain responsive to changes.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Only changed files and their relationships are reprocessed
- Relationship graph is updated incrementally without full rebuild
- Cross-file dependencies are properly maintained during updates
- Update performance scales logarithmically with codebase size
- Incremental updates maintain data consistency
- Full rebuild option is available when needed
- Update status provides clear progress information

### Story 4.5: Performance Monitoring
**As a developer, I want performance monitoring so that I can understand system behavior with my codebase.**

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Processing time metrics are collected for all major operations
- Memory usage is tracked during analysis phases
- Performance reports identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Metrics can be exported for analysis
- Performance trends are visible over time
- Warnings are provided for performance issues
- Optimization recommendations are generated when appropriate

## Dependencies
- Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (must be completed)
- Epic 2: Language Parsing & Relationship Extraction (must be completed)
- Epic 3: Blueprint Generation System (must be completed)
- Functional System Map and JSON Mirrors
- Working blueprint generation system

## Success Criteria
- System handles 10,000+ file codebases efficiently
- Incremental updates complete within 5 seconds for typical changes
- Blueprint generation maintains sub-30-second performance targets
- Memory usage remains under 2GB for large codebase analysis
- Cache hit rates exceed 80% for repeated operations
- Performance monitoring provides actionable insights
- All performance optimization components have â‰¥80% test coverage
