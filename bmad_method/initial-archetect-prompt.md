## Initial Architect Prompt

This section provides initial technical guidance and key considerations for the Architect designing the `arch_blueprint_generator` module for the Architectum platform. The primary goal of this module is to generate structured JSON "blueprints" of codebases for consumption by AI agents and secondarily for developer visualization tools, as detailed in this PRD and associated Epics.

### Technical Infrastructure

-   **Starter Project/Template:** The `arch_blueprint_generator` is to be developed as a new module/package within the **existing `Architectum` repository**. The module should be named `arch_blueprint_generator`.
-   **Hosting/Cloud Provider:** The module will be part of the larger `Architectum` application. Its hosting will align with `Architectum`'s existing infrastructure. *(Architect to confirm if any module-specific considerations are needed).*
-   **Frontend Platform:** Not directly applicable for the core blueprint generation logic, which is AI-consumed. Any human-facing UI for invoking this module or visualizing its output is considered a separate concern, potentially leveraging `Architectum`'s existing frontend if applicable.
-   **Backend Platform (for `arch_blueprint_generator` module):**
    -   A key decision for the Architect is the **choice of language(s) and core libraries/frameworks** for implementing the `arch_blueprint_generator` module.
    -   Considerations should include:
        -   Availability and quality of libraries for source code parsing (e.g., AST generation) for initial target languages (see "Language Parsing Strategy" below).
        -   Performance characteristics.
        -   Ease of integration with the main `Architectum` application.
        -   Team familiarity (if a factor for `Architectum` development).
    -   The PRD and Epics mention Python and JavaScript as *examples* of languages to be parsed, not necessarily the implementation language of the generator itself.
-   **Database Requirements:**
    -   No explicit database is required for the core MVP functionality of generating blueprints on demand.
    -   However, the Architect should consider if a caching mechanism (e.g., in-memory, Redis, or a lightweight DB) would be beneficial for:
        -   Caching frequently accessed file parse trees or generated blueprints to improve performance for repeated requests on unchanged code.
        -   Storing intermediate results for very large or complex analysis if synchronous processing becomes too slow.
    -   Any such caching should be an optional enhancement or a configurable feature.

### Technical Constraints

-   **Primary Output:** The module *must* generate JSON blueprints adhering to the structures implied by the `DirectoryBlueprint`, `FileSetBlueprint`, and `CodeElementBlueprint` types, and the `Minimal`, `Standard`, and `Detailed` levels as specified in the PRD and Epics.
-   **Machine Readability:** The JSON output structure must be highly predictable, well-documented, and easily parsable by programmatic agents (critical NFR). The schema for these blueprints should be explicitly defined as part of the architectural design.
-   **Integration:** The module must be integrable within the existing `Architectum` application, callable via an internal API or as a library. The Epics define CLI/API interfaces for invoking its functionality.
-   **Code Access:** Assume that the `Architectum` application will handle access to the source code (e.g., reading files from a local path, from a checked-out repository) and will pass either file paths or file contents to the `arch_blueprint_generator` module. The module itself should not need to manage repository cloning or direct VCS interactions for MVP.

### Deployment Considerations

-   The `arch_blueprint_generator` module will be deployed as part of the main `Architectum` application.
-   It should integrate with `Architectum`'s existing CI/CD pipelines and deployment strategies.
-   Ensure module versioning is considered if its API/schema evolves independently of the main application.

### Local Development & Testing Requirements

-   **Testability:** The module must be designed for high testability. This includes:
    -   Unit tests for parsing logic for different code constructs and languages.
    -   Unit tests for blueprint generation logic (correct structure and content for each blueprint type and detail level).
    -   Integration tests for the module's API/CLI interfaces.
-   **Test Data:** A strategy for managing test data (e.g., sample code snippets, small example codebases in target languages) will be crucial for verifying correctness.
-   **Standalone Execution:** It should be possible to run and test the `arch_blueprint_generator` module or its core logic in isolation during development, even if it's ultimately part of a larger system.

### Other Technical Considerations

-   **Language Parsing Strategy:**
    -   This is a critical architectural decision. The Architect needs to propose a robust and extensible strategy for parsing source code.
    -   Options might include: Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsers (e.g., Python's `ast` module, `esprima` for JavaScript), ANTLR, tree-sitter, or other compiler-front-end technologies.
    -   **Initial Supported Languages for MVP:** The Architect should recommend 1-2 languages for initial MVP support based on parser availability, complexity, and project priorities (e.g., Python, JavaScript have been used as examples). The design should allow for adding support for more languages later.
    -   The design should consider how to handle code comments, annotations/decorators, and other language-specific constructs relevant to the defined detail levels.
-   **Performance & Scalability:**
    -   Blueprint generation time must be reasonable for interactive use by an AI or developer. (Refer to NFRs in PRD - specific benchmarks TBD but design for efficiency).
    -   The system should handle varying sizes of input (single files to large directories) gracefully.
    -   Consider strategies for efficient file traversal, selective parsing, and minimizing memory footprint, especially for `Detailed` blueprints or large scopes.
-   **Error Handling:**
    -   Implement robust error handling for scenarios such as invalid file paths, unparseable code, elements not found, unsupported language features, etc.
    -   Errors should be clearly communicated in the JSON output or via appropriate error responses/codes.
-   **Extensibility & Maintainability:**
    -   The architecture should facilitate future enhancements, such as:
        -   Adding support for new programming languages.
        -   Introducing new blueprint types or extending existing ones.
        -   Adding new detail levels or refining existing ones.
    -   Clear separation of concerns (e.g., parsing, data transformation, output generation) is important.
-   **Configuration:**
    -   The mechanism for passing parameters (target paths/files/elements, detail level, scan depth) is defined in the Epics (API/CLI). Ensure the internal design makes these configurations easy to manage.
-   **Data Handling & Privacy:**
    -   Blueprints will contain snippets or structural representations of source code. While the module itself doesn't persist this data by default (beyond the request lifecycle), if caching is implemented, ensure it's handled securely, especially if the source code is proprietary or sensitive. The main `Architectum` application is responsible for the overall security of the codebase it handles.

Please design an architecture that emphasizes clean separation of concerns, maintainability, and extensibility. The primary goal is to provide a reliable and accurate source of codebase understanding for AI agents. We anticipate this module becoming a foundational piece for many future AI-driven development capabilities within Architectum.
